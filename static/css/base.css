}

/* Re the body above - Next we need to add the background image to the body element.
Which we can do with the size of cover and options of no-repeat center centre and fixed.
which will ensure that it stays put in the centre of the page.
I also want to add a height calculation to the body element.
Which will be 100vh minus 164 pixels the eventual height of our top header.
Finally I'll add a default font colour and font family for the body of the site.
If we run the server and check it out now it's anow dispalys the picture of the girl

Which will ensure that whenever we use font awesome icons.
They will always stay perfectly centred and have a consistent size

just makes it so that the logo only takes up as much space as the text requires and no more. */

the site for buttons so that they match the theme of the shop now button on the homepage. */

Bootstrap doesn't actually have a black class as of this recording.
So I'm creating my own and I've marked them as important.
Because we will always want elements using these classes to obey them
These classes will allow us to have both primary and secondary call-to-action styling

        padding-top: 164px;

/* The second one will add 164 pixels of padding to our header container class
to push the body down to the bottom of the main page header.
This is the page header block that we added at the top of the index.html page in the home app.
The other class in this media query will be for the main site navbar, we add in the coming videos.
For both of these classes, I'm using a minimum screen width of 992 pixels.
Since the main header will look different on mobile views.
So we only want these to affect medium and larger screens. */
